Q1. Bagging is a special case of random forests under which case?
Answer: when m=p, bagging is a special case of random forests.
Q2. What are the hyperparameters we can control for random forests?
Answer: m: the number of predictors in a random subset; 
Q3. Suppose you have the following paired data of (x,y): (1,2), (1,5), (2,0). Which of the following are valid bootstrapped data sets? Why/why not?
(1,0), (1,2), (1,5)
(1,2), (2,0)
(1,2), (1,2), (1,5)
Answer: (1,2), (2,0) and (1,2), (1,2), (1,5)
For each of the above valid bootstapped data sets, which observations are out-of-bag (OOB)?
You make a random forest consisting of four trees. You obtain a new observation of predictors, and would like to predict the response. What would your prediction be in the following cases?
Regression: your trees make the following four predictions: 1,1,3,3.
Classification: your trees make the following four predictions: “A”, “A”, “B”, “C”.
