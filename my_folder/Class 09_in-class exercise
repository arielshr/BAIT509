Q1. Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has x1=6 and x2=10?

Classification rule: x1 = 7.5
I would class the new observation to A since it's left to the classifier.

Q2. What size is the margin here?

Size of margin: 2

Q3. Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?

Observation receiving a penalty: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Support vectors: Observation 8, 9

Q4. What is the total penalty here?

0.25 + 0.25 + 1.75 + 2.25 + 1.25 = 5.75

Q5. Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?

Yes, since now we still have 0.25 margin left to increase to 6.

Q6. Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?

Yes.
Support vectors: Observation 4, 8, 9
