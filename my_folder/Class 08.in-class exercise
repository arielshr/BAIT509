For (1) and (2) below, you’re choosing between two candidates to hire. Discuss the pros and cons of choosing one candidate over the other in the following situations.

Q1. Both are predicted to have the same productivity score of 75, but have the following probabilistic forecasts.

Though they have the same mean of 75, A has a more stable probability distribution than B since it's more concentrated. The productivity of A wouldn't fluctuate significantly during the work, so that he can ensure a consistent working efficiency and avoid significant task delays. However, the productivity of B can sometimes increase to over 80, which cannot be achieved by A since its highest productivity is about 77, so that B can complete the work highly efficient sometimes. 

Correct: A: less risky, B: gamble, but sometimes achieve possible higher productivity.

Q2. Two “non-overlapping” forecasts:

A has a more concentrated distribution with a lower mean of 60, while B has a decentralized distribution with a higher mean of 80. Since the lowest possible productivity of B is still higher than the highest possible productivity of A, I would go with B because B can ensure an overall higher productivity than A. However, the fluctuation in B's productivity could be large, which indicates that when we need to promise our client's a delivery date, it would be hard for us to estimate a suitable date and might have significant delays.

Q3. You’ve formed a probabilist forecast for a particular value of the predictors, displayed below as a density. You then collect test data for that same value of the predictor, indicated as the points below the density. What is the problem with the probabilistic forecast?

The probability forecast is biased. Reduce K values to fix this problem.
